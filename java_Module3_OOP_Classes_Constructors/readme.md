# Module 5 Java OOP Programs

This repository contains five Java programs demonstrating basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, objects, constructors, getters, setters, and method usage.

---

## List of Programs

1. Employee.java
   A class that uses private variables with getter and setter methods.

2. Cellphone.java
   A simple class that prints basic cellphone actions.

3. Book.java
   Demonstrates constructor overloading with three constructors.

4. Cylinder.java
   Uses getters, setters, default and parameterized constructors, and includes methods to calculate surface area and volume.

5. Main.java
   Tests all the above classes by creating objects and displaying output.

## Folder Structure



## How to Run the Programs

Step 1: Compile the Java files

```
javac *.java
```

Step 2: Run the main program

```
java Main
```

Make sure all .java files are in the same folder when compiling and running.
